# SFHR-Mods
I will put all the SFHR Mods that I made in the Release. 

# Basic Instructions

1. ALWAYS BACK UP YOUR SAVE FILE! 
Copy and Paste `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Sky9 Games\Strike Force Heroes` into your file explorer and back up the file `SaveGame.sfh`.

2. Use a [Modloader](https://github.com/Jody2731/SFHR-Modloader/releases) to load the Mods into the game.
	
3. Use the Mods(.dll) with the versions that are matched with the game's current version. An outdated Mod could possibly not working.
	
4. Report any issue you have encountered. My Discord: `jody2731`


# Mods Instructions v1.19

Inventory Expansion
---------------------------------------------------
Feature:
- Expand your Inventory space to 600.

Safe To Use?
- Yes. The way this Mod works is forcibly modifying the original calculated value of Max Inventory Space to 600. Technically it will not harm your save file because it will not reach anything related to saved data.

Notes:
- The Max Inventory Space will drop back to the normal amount if the Mod is not loaded; in this case all the exceeded items will still be saved but you will not be able to add anything into your inventory until you have cleaned all of the exceeded items in your inventory/load the Inventory Expansion Mod.

Skin Replacing
---------------------------------------------------
Feature:
- Allows the user to replace the skins they want with the specified skin(if there are more than 1 specified replacing skin, they will get picked randomly)

Safe To Use?
- Yes. There are tons of error detecting features in this mod and in case there is something that could potentially make the game crashes the mod will automatically shut itself down. The Mod itself will also not reach any things related to saved data so do not worry about save corruption.

Notes:
- Please check the Skin_Replacing_Config.txt file to get more instructions on how to use this mod. Also always keep the configuration file in the same directory/folder as the mod(.dll file) itself.
