# SFHR-Mods
I will put all the SFHR Mods that I made in the Release. 

# Basic Instructions

1. ALWAYS BACK UP YOUR SAVE FILE! 
Copy and Paste `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\Sky9 Games\Strike Force Heroes` into your file explorer and back up the file `SaveGame.sfh`.

2. Use a [Modloader](https://github.com/Jody2731/SFHR-Modloader/releases) to load the Mods into the game.
	
3. Use the Mods(.dll) with the versions that are matched with the game's current version. An outdated Mod could possibly not working.
	
4. Report any issue you have encountered. My Discord: `jody2731`


# Mods Instructions v1.17

Inventory Expansion
---------------------------------------------------
Feature:
- Expand your Inventory space to 600.

Save To Use?
- Yes. The way this Mod works is forcibly modifying the original calculated value of Max Inventory Space to 600. Technically it will not harm your save file.

Notes:
- The Max Inventory Space will drop back to the normal amount if the Mod is not loaded; in this case all the exceeded items will still be saved but you will not be able to add anything into your inventory until you have cleaned all of the exceeded items in your inventory/load the Inventory Expansion Mod.
